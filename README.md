```

## Configuration

To customize the booking parameters, update the variables in the `index.js` file. Here's how you can modify the variables:

4. Save the `index.js` file after making the necessary changes.

## Usage

To run the Puppeteer Booking Script and automate the booking process, follow these steps:

```sh
node index.js
```

4. The script will launch a headless Chrome browser and perform the booking process based on the provided parameters.
